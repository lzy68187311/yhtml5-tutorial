- [x] Allow server can accessible externally
- [x] Dynamically generated html
- [x] Custom domain name 
- [x] Create git npm script
- [ ] Code is too big after webpack, it always bigger then compressed package which provided by the third party
    * set devtool: "false" in production environment
    * set NODE_ENV=production
    * don't webpack, but use third party like `*.min.*` command

- [ ] It looks like you're using a minified copy of the development build of React. 
      When deploying React apps to production, 
      make sure to use the production build which skips development warnings and is faster.

- [x] Hot Module Replacement VS reload 
    * index.jsx | add `import {AppContainer} from 'react-hot-loader';` 
    * index.jsx | add `if (module.hot) {}` in the index.jsx
    * webpack.js | add `entry: {hot: ['react-hot-loader/patch', 'webpack-dev-server/client?http://localhost:61200', 'webpack/hot/only-dev-server'] },`
    * webpack.js | add `new HtmlWebpackPlugin` and set `{chunks: ['index', 'vendor', 'hot', 'manifest']` 
    * webpack.js | set `devServer.hot: true`

- [x] externals vs resolve vs require [use resolve][webpack-optimize-resolve]
    * set `externals: { moment: true}` and add `<script src="//cdn.com/moment.min.js"></script>`
    * set `resolve: { alias: {moment: "moment/min/moment-with-locales.min.js"}}`
    * set `var moment = require('moment/min/moment-with-locales.min.js');`
- [ ] Hot Module Replacement can't work when *.css changed
    * you can use postCSS (using CSS Modules)
- [ ] 加载策略：按需加载，预加载，并线加载，异步加载
- [ ] support less sass css-module, 首屏内联样式    
- [ ] add .eslintrc, eslint
- [ ] webpack打包第三方类库的正确姿势
- [ ] 推送线上，接收脚本，自动化部署
- [ ] A CLI dashboard for webpack dev server [webpack-dashboard]
